# Paper data and code

This is the project page for the paper "Evaluating the consistency of word embeddings from small data". You can find the datasets used in the paper here.

UPDATE: Unfortunately, it does not appear that it's possible for us to release most of these datasets for copyright reasons, as the books from the Quine corpus are copyrighted, so the Quine-based sets have been made private. If you do own Word and Object and/or System of Logistic, contact us for the derived data sets. For other cases, corpus reproduction instructions will follow shortly.

The next two datasets were only used for the domain comparison experiment summarized in Table 5 of the paper.
